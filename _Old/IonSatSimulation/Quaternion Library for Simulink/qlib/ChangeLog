	* Changed mux to bus creator blocks where appropriate.

	* Added "Row Major to Matrix" and "Matrix to Row Major" blocks to
	aid with interfacing with the matrix signals now available in
	Simulink.

	* release of 1.7

        * Modified masks to work with Simulink 4.0.  The default value of
	the FontSize parameter for blocks has changed in Simulink 4.0 to a
	value of -1.  This means use the DefaultBlockFontSize parameter
	from the parent model to determine font size.  I can't find a way
	to determine the value of DefaultBlockFontSize in the
	initialization portion of the mask, so I assume it to be 10 (the
	default font size when I created the library).

	* release of 1.2

	* Contents.m: Changed "Quaternion Integration" to "Quaternion
	Propagation".  Updated dates, version number.

	* qlib: Renamed "Quaternion Integration" to "Quaternion
	Propagation", and fixed its internals.  The [w 0] "quaternion" and
	the quaternion were being multiplied in the wrong order, and the
	lack of an internal quaternion renormalization caused the output
	to degrade and eventually become useless.
