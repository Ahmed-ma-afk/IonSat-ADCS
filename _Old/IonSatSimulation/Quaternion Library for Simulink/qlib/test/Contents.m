% Unit and Timing tests for the Quaternions SIMULINK library
%
% NOTE: You need the test_tools toolbox to run these tests.  It should be
% available from the same place this toolbox was obtained.
%
%   This script runs unit tests on all blocks:
%
%     unit_test
%
%   The following tests compare the timing of different algorithms for
%   each function.  The fastest algorithm was used in the library.
%
%     qnorm_test 
%     qmult_test
